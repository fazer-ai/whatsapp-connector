// An offer refused by a session that is stopping must not mark it. The mark schedules a
// drain, and the drain claims the stream with no minimum idle time -- so an account this
// instance is deliberately giving up would have its stream taken from under the owner
// taking it over, and the entries handed back at age zero, below the idle floor that
// owner's own reclaim watches.
//
// Written against the map rather than through Release, and that is the point of it being
// here: Release deletes the session before it stops it, so today an offer can only be
// refused as stopped once the lookup in Dispatch already misses. Reorder those two lines
// -- stop the session, then forget it, which reads more naturally than what is there --
// and the window opens. This holds the rule instead of the accident that hides it.
